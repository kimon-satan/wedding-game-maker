Welcome to our wedding!

Do you have a glass of Prosecco in hand ? Good !

Next wedding task - work out where you're sitting. Luckily
for you we've devised a little game which will show you to
your seat through holding erudite conversations with your
fellow guests. The rules are simple:

1. Use the opener phrase on the page opposite
to start a conversation with one of your fellow guests.

2. When they reply, use the table to work out what to say
next.

3. If you don't recognise their response then use the excuse
phrase at the bottom of the table and back away discreetly.

4. Some conversations will reveal which table you are sitting
at, but most will come to a natural end.

5. If you find your conversation is going round and round in
circles then you are like-minded folk who are sitting on
the same table.
