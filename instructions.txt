Here is a little game in place of a table plan. Discover your table through holding erudite conversations with each other. The rules are simple ...

- Find someone, anyone.
- Use the opener to start a conversation.
- When they reply use the table to work out your next line.
- If their response isn't on the table then use the excuse and back away discreetly.
- Some conversations reveal your table, but most will come to a natural end.
- If a conversation goes round in circles then you are like-minded folk who are sitting together.
