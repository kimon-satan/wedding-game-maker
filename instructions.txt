Here is a little game in place of a table plan.
Discover your table through holding erudite conversations with your fellow guests.
The rules are simple ...

- Find a fellow guest.
- Use the opener phrase to start a conversation with them.
- When they reply use the table to work out your next line.
- If their response isn't on the table then back away discreetly using the excuse phrase.
- Some conversations will reveal which table you are sitting at, but most will come to a natural end.
- If you find your conversation is going round and round in circles then you are like-minded folk who are sitting on the same table.
